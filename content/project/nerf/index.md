This project reimplements the paper "NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis"[1]. The Neural Radiance Field, or NeRF, has exploded in popularity since its first debut in ECCV 2020. This image-based rendering technique shows impressive results in reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a set of calibrated 2D images. Due to its widespread use in both academia and industry, we hope to learn NeRF by reimplementing it from scratch in PyTorch.
