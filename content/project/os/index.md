This project designed experiments to measure the performance of a Linux system w.r.t. CPU, RAM, network, and file system in C. Also, it analyzed relationships between various system metrics and utilized benchmarks to identify performance bottlenecks.

The benchmarks include:
- CPU, Scheduling, and OS Services
  - Procedure call overhead
  - System call overhead
  - Task creation time
  - Context switch time

- Memory
  - RAM access time
  - RAM bandwidth
  - Page fault service time

- Network
  - Round trip time
  - Peak bandwidth
  - Connection overhead

- File System
  - Size of file cache
  - File read time
  - Remote file read time
  - Contention
